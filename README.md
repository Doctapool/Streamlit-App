# Creating a web application with Streamlit to showcase a time series model powered by Facebook Prophet ✨

 

📚 **Description**
=================
This undertaking entails the implementation of two graphical user interfaces featuring my top-performing models for distinct projects. Specifically, the deployment involves applying the Facebook Prophet model for time series on Streamlit and deploying a logistic regression classifier using Gradio, as outlined below:

🔧 **Installation**
-----------------
To get started , follow these installation steps:
```bash
# setup the environment on windows by running the following code.
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

 

#On Linux
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

 

```
The Two commands are of the same structure
1.Activate the python environment
2.Upgrade pip to it current version
3.install the requirements located in requirements.txt: You should be at the root of your env
